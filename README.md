# Warehouse Automation Using Arduino

## Description :
The project is to minimize the work of peoples in the warehouses where the objects are movied from
one place to another using human controlled cranes.
This will be a totally automated solution to reduce the work and improve the production by reducing the time taken
The line following robot,track its path and then sense the endings to activate the robotic arm to grab the objects.
The both endings are detected when there is an object detected at the end of each path.
The robotic arm is used to grab and drop items.
Servo motors used for robotic arms.

## Enhancements :
This Line following concept is replaced by AI based path finding algorithms, to detect the shortest path to the ends.
The path will be manipulated using Deep Learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks to sense the image and 
detect the paths.

## Duration :
This project takes 3 days to complete.
